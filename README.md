# A tensorflow based standard model for Kaggle MNIST Competition

This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network for recognizing hand written digits using the MNIST dataset. This model attains a validation accuracy of about 99.6% is obtained after training for 20 epochs.

# Requirements
Python 3
Tensorflow
Keras
numpy
matplotlib
pandas

# Dataset
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

The file train.csv contains pixel intensity values as flattened vectors for 42000 images and their corresponding labels. Similarly, test.csv has pixel intensity values for 28000 unlabelled images.
